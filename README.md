# -AtliQ_Hospitality_Analysis_PowerBI
I have built a dashboard in Power BI to analyze three months sales data of different AtliQ hotels across four different cities.






I have downloaded this dataset from codebasics website and performed analysis.
# Problem statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

# Task List

We have been provided a sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task:

Create the metrics according to the metric list.
Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

# Learnings from the project
-Learnt, how to use bookmarks and selection for different purposes. (Page navigation and clear filter button in the dashboard was achieved using bookmarks and selection. website like page navigation YouTube tutorial )

-By referring different cancellation polices followed by different hotels, understood that most of the hotels charge zero fee, only if the booking is cancelled before three months of booking date. If the booking is cancelled after that, the charge range from 60 to 90% of the booking cost.
